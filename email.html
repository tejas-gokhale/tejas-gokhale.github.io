For prospective students:

<p> I get a LOT of email. </p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are interested in the Ph.D. program at UMBC, you'll have to apply directly via the university. </li>
	<li>If you are interested in MS research, please take one of my classes first and talk to me during office hours. I ignore all other emails about MS research.</li>
	<li>If you are interested in BS research, please take one of my classes first and talk to me during office hours.</li>
	<li>I do not offer any volunteer positions in my group -- all emails asking for such opportunities will be ignored.</li>
	<li>I cannot circumvent UMBC class enrolment and waiting lists -- all emails asking to be added to my class will be ignored.</li>
</ul>
